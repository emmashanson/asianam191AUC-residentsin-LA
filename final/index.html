                            <h3>Project Description</h3>
                                <p>The issue of homelessness in LA has been ongoing for decades and has been exacerbated in recent years due to the pandemic. Our project aims to shed light on the root causes of homelessness, namely restrictive zoning laws, concentration of property ownership, and policies that push more people out onto the streets without providing resources for them (aka NIMBYism). </p>

                                <p>For our project, we hope to map out the places and neighborhoods of origin of residents in these projects in order to visualize the displacement of low-income non-native English-speaker seniors, specifically Japanese elders in the Little Tokyo Towers and Miyako Gardens housing projects.</p>
                                <p>Little Tokyo, one of the last-remaining historic Japantowns in the U.S., is situated in Downtown L.A.. As of 2015, 25% of the population consists of adults aged 65 years or older. Additionally, 60% of this older population is linguistically isolated‚Äî meaning that they report not speaking English ‚Äúvery well‚Äù‚Äî while 70% of older householders in Little Tokyo live alone. As such, retirement homes for elderly and retired aren‚Äôt always accommodating for the linguistic, cultural, and community needs of the Little Tokyo elderly population. 

                                    Currently, the only two Section 8 housing projects in Little Tokyo are the Little Tokyo Towers and Miyako Gardens Apartments which offer housing to qualifying low-income seniors 62 and older. </p>

                            <h3>Our Connections</h3>
                            <p>We are members of UCLA Nikkei Student Union, a Japanese American cultural organization that participates in areas such as community service in Little Tokyo, where these housing projects were talked about</p>
                            <h3>Who We Want to Empower, and How  </h3>
                                <p>Our project will benefit and empower low-income, Japanese senior citizens and their caregivers, as well as several nonprofits that provide resources and community aid to elders in Little Tokyo; Keiro, Little Tokyo Service Center (LTSC), and Little Tokyo Historical Society (LTHS). These nonprofits that work with Asian elders and tenants in the projects themselves will be empowered with a more comprehensive understanding of their communities and will be able to have their stories heard.
                                    Residents in Little Tokyo, particularly Asian elders and tenants of housing projects, will be empowered to share their personal experiences related to housing, which would raise awareness of issues and problems they face when it comes to housing insecurity.</p> -->
