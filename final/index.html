                            <h3>Project Description</h3>
                                <p>The issue of homelessness in LA has been ongoing for decades and has been exacerbated in recent years due to the pandemic. Our project aims to shed light on the root causes of homelessness, namely restrictive zoning laws, concentration of property ownership, and policies that push more people out onto the streets without providing resources for them (aka NIMBYism). </p>
                            
                            <h3>Our Connections</h3>
                            <p>We are members of UCLA Nikkei Studen Union, a Japanese American cultural organization that participates in areas such as community service in Little Tokyo, where these housing projects were talked about</p>
                            <h3>Who We Want to Empower, and How  </h3>
                                <p>Our project will benefit and empower people policymakers in Los Angeles to create more equitable and just laws governing housing. With this knowledge and information on housing policies, voters will also be more informed on the realities of housing policies and how they have historically shaped and continue to shape homelessness in LA county.</p>
