### What social problem is being addressed?
The issue of homelessness in LA has been ongoing for decades and has been exacerbated in recent years due to the pandemic. Our project aims to shed light on the root causes of homelessness, namely restrictive zoning laws, concentration of property ownership, and policies that push more people out onto the streets without providing resources for them (aka NIMBYism). Our project will visualize the progression of redlining and other restrictive housing policies that have plagued Los Angeles for the past century.
### Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
Our project will benefit and empower people policymakers in Los Angeles to create more equitable and just laws governing housing. With this knowledge and information on housing policies, voters will also be more informed on the realities of housing policies and how they have historically shaped and continue to shape homelessness in LA county.
### What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
It may be difficult to obtain accurate and ethically-sourced data due to the fact that voting records for private citizens are sealed for privacy reasons. People who are homeless may also be hesitant to share information with data collectors and the nature of the homeless population is transient, so it will be difficult to map out concentrated areas of homeless encampments.
