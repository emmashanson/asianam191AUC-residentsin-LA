# Community Sentiment of Little Tokyo Towers / Miyako Gardens
### Objective: What social problem is being addressed?
Little Tokyo, one of the last-remaining historic Japantowns in the U.S., is situated in Downtown L.A.. As of 2015, 25% of the population consists of adults aged 65 years or older. Additionally, 60% of this older population is linguistically isolated— meaning that they report not speaking English “very well”— while 70% of older householders in Little Tokyo live alone. As such, retirement homes for elderly and retired aren’t always accommodating for the linguistic, cultural, and community needs of the Little Tokyo elderly population. 

Currently, the only two Section 8 housing projects in Little Tokyo are the Little Tokyo Towers and Miyako Gardens Apartments which offer housing to qualifying low-income seniors 62 and older. For our project, we hope to map out the places and neighborhoods of origin of residents in these projects in order to visualize the displacement of low-income non-native English-speaker seniors, specifically Japanese elders in the Little Tokyo Towers and Miyako Gardens housing projects. On these markers, we will have another tab that describes the experiences of those living in these homes and the impact that these residential communities have had. 
### Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
Our project will benefit and empower low-income, Japanese senior citizens and their caregivers, as well as several nonprofits that provide resources and community aid to elders in Little Tokyo; Keiro, Little Tokyo Service Center (LTSC), and Little Tokyo Historical Society (LTHS). These nonprofits that work with Asian elders and tenants in the projects themselves will be empowered with a more comprehensive understanding of their communities and will be able to have their stories heard.
Residents in Little Tokyo, particularly Asian elders and tenants of housing projects, will be empowered to share their personal experiences related to housing, which would raise awareness of issues and problems they face when it comes to housing insecurity.

### Technologies behind this mapplication and how it can be used in the future
1. Swoopy arrows-using this leaflet plugin, we were able to show where the resident's hometowns were, and from there, the arrow indicates how are their move was to the center location of Little Tokyo Towers and Miyko Gardens (both residences are in ~500 feet proximity). This is a great visual indicator of the move for these people and shows the geographic origins, in a way where the user can absorb that visual information without having to filter through words. 
2. chart-(add explanation later)
3. Button- the buttons on the map, when press, display the name of the former hometown that the resident formerly lived, as well as their feelings about leaving thier old home. This huamizes the data point more in that there is a story behind the blue dot on the map.

Another thank you to our classmates, seeing peer surveys, websites, etc are all great ways in learning and improving our own mapplication and seeing the potential that is there!
