### Objective: What social problem is being addressed?
Little Tokyo, one of the last-remaining historic Japantowns in the U.S., is situated in Downtown L.A.. As of 2015, 25% of the population consists of adults aged 65 years or older. Currently, the only two Section 8 housing projects in Little Tokyo are the Little Tokyo Towers and Miyako Gardens Apartments which offer housing to qualifying low-income seniors 62 and older. 

For our project, we hope to map out the places and neighborhoods of origin of residents in these projects in order to visualize the displacement of low-income non-native English-speaker seniors, specifically Japanese elders in the Little Tokyo Towers and Miyako Gardens housing projects. On these markers, we will have another tab that describes the experiences of those living in these homes and the impact that these residential communities have had.

### Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
Our project will benefit and empower low-income, Japanese senior citizens and their caregivers, as well as several nonprofits that provide resources and community aid to elders in Little Tokyo. Residents in Little Tokyo, particularly Asian elders and tenants of housing projects, will be empowered to share their personal experiences related to housing, which would raise awareness of issues and problems they face when it comes to housing insecurity.

### How it can be repurposed
It can be repurposed for any kind of project where user stores being highlighted would be the key objective of the website. Our interactive chart aims to be the focal point of the website outside of the map, showing a summary of user experiences, taken from the survey. More specifically, based on our code, websites with the goal of reflecting the orgin of different people who now live in a common area would be the easiest to repurpose.  For instance, repurposing this mapplication to plot zipcodes of each student who attends UCLA and seeing "hotspots" of where students most often come from, and depending on the radius from the school, feelings about homesickness and overall wellbeing.

### Future Implications
In the future, we would like community members to continue to add onto this website about their experiences and show the numerous stories on the same platform. Potentially in the future, we woud like nonprofit organizations in Little Tokyo such as Keiro, California based non profit organization aidig in housing to expand these housing projects outside of Little Tokyo and broaden its horizons to other areas in California, and even nationwide!  As America's immigration population continues to grow, retirement homes should not only be catered to English-speakers only, and this project is the first micro-step to showcase that.

### Room for Improvement
1. Optimize the code, especially or charting and swoopy arrows since it can be slow at times, overall simplifying the process down
2. Further improving language accessability within all areas of our project
